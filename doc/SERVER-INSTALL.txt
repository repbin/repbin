Installing a repbin server
--------------------------

If you do not know how to handle a unix sytem, stop here. You'll just hurt yourself in the process.
We assume that you have Tor running and know how to configure it to run a hidden service. Furthermore
you need to be able to create a new user on the system.

Basic installation of a standalone server
-----------------------------------------
 0. The server's filesystem must support symlinks and chtimes
 1. Install/Compile the binary, as described in COMPILE.txt
 2. Configure Tor to point a hidden service to 127.0.0.1:Port (Port is the port number of the repserver).
    Make sure that you restart Tor to have it generate the hostname of the hidden service.
 3. Create a new user specifically and exclusively for repbin usage. It should have minimum access
    to filesystem resources.
 4. Change to the new user
 5. Create a new directory for the user to store message data in:
    $ STOREDIR=/path/to/userhome/store/
    $ mkdir $STOREDIR
 6. Create initial configuration file:
    $ repserver --showconfig > repserver.config
 7. Edit the configuration file to change the storage path. Change the value of "StoragePath" to
    the absolute path of $STOREDIR. Make sure the value ends with a slash (/).
 8. If needed, change the SocksProxy entry to the URL of your Tor client.
 9. Change the values of EnableDeleteHandler and EnableOneTimeHander to true IF you want these features.
    EnableOneTimeHander adds the ability to delete messages from the server by anybody knowing the
    Message-ID and the constant private key of the message. This is not a good idea unless you have
    pressing need to enable this feature.
    EnableOneTimeHander allows the use of the repserver for storing messages that are deleted as soon
    as they are fetched the first time. This is of dubious security.
    We recommend keeping both settings switched off ("false").
10. Change the ListenPort entry to an unused TCP port on localhost. This must be the port that the 
    hiddenservice configuration of Tor points to.
11. Change the URL setting to the _full URL_ of your Tor hidden service (it should look similar to this:
    http://abcdefghijkl.onion/" - note the leading schema and the trailing slash).
12. Do not modify other entries unless you know exactly what you do. Save your changes to file.
13. Start the server:
	$ repserver --configfile repserver.config --verbose --start
14. You're done. The server does not go into the background itself.
    Put it into background manually or run it in a screen/tmux session.

Client's need to use the onion address of your hidden service by either changing their config-files or
specifying the --server commandline option.

Please be aware that there is no locking utilised in repserver. Only one instance should be running at a
time. Running multiple instances accessing the same $STORAGEDIR WILL lead to catastrophic results, 
including security nightmares and dead cats.


Peering with other servers
--------------------------
To replicate posts from/to other servers, peering needs to be configured. This is a manual process
and there will not be a peer discovery feature for repbin.

After starting the repserver, $STOREDIR will contain a new file: $STOREDIR/peers.config .
This file contains the information required to peer with other servers.
To add a peer, create a new JSON list entry (or change the example) so that:
- PubKey contains the peer's PeeringPublicKey
- URL contains the peer's hidden service address as a full URI

You can change the peers.config file while the server is running. It will be reloaded automatically.
Errors in the format of the file will lead to peering becoming unavailable until a well-formatted file is 
reloaded again.


Administration tasks
--------------------
repserver should clean up house itself, but it will leave some files forever. Please plan for enough space.
Do NOT move the files or you will destroy the chtime of the files (unless you know how to use tar, touch, 
cp etc). The chtime is required for part of the housecleaning process. Changing it will lead to files that
linger for too long.

After repserver has received his first files and/or peered with other repservers, the $STOREDIR will
contain a number of directories containing various files. These files are paged textfiles (every entry
is of a defined length). Changing any of the files manually can lead to strange results, including
making the system unusable or breaking limits and access limitations. Great care is required if manual
changes are required.

File that MIGHT required changes are in the peers directory. Every peer has his own file here that keeps
track of peer status. If a peer is reset (by deleting his posts), the peer status needs to be reset as 
well. The easiest method is to find the peer and delete his status file. Other changes are simply 
dangerous.


Security
--------
The software is likely insecure in some bad ways, including but not limited to giving access to files
for reading, writing and changing.
It is highly recommended to run it in a dedicated chroot, a dedicated virtual server, or on a dedicated
machine. You have been warned.


Hosting a website
-----------------
The index of the repserver shows a "404 Not found" error by default. If you want to spice-up your 
repserver you may create a directory $STOREDIR/static and put files into it. These files will be
served as with any other standard websert. It does however not support dynamic content, redirects and
similar features. Just create $STOREDIR/static/index.html to speak to the world!
