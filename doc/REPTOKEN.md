## Using reptoken to pre-calculate resource tokens

When called without parameters, reptoken will create one token and output it on stderr. This is usually not what you need.

The other two modes are "directory" and "continue".

++Directory++ will create tokens and store them in a directory. Call:

	reptoken -outDir $Directory

This will forever create tokens and store them in $Directory. Repclient can use these tokens when given the "-signdir $Directory" option. Used signer files will be deleted by repclient.

++Continue++ will continue working on a single token and add more bits as it
can. The token will be updated and can be used concurrently by repclient. Call:

	reptoken --continue --outFile $File

For this $File must already exist (generated by reptoken -outFile $File).
Repclient can use the file using the "-signkey $File" option. The file will not
be removed by repclient.

The additional option -minBits modifies the target bits for collision creation.
This defines the _minimum_ bits to find, it does not constitute an upper limit.
